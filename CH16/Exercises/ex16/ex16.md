# Chapter 16 Exercise 16

(a) An enumeration constant may represent any integer specified by the programmer.
    True - example below:
```
enum example {
    ENUM1 = 69,
    ENUM2 = 420,
    ENUM3 = 666,
}
```

(b) Enumeration constants have exactly the same properties as constants created using `#define`.
    False - one big difference is that enums are scoped and only available within the function 
               they were defined in.

(c) Enumeration constants have the values 0. 1.2, ... by default.
    True

(d) All constants in an enumeration must have different values.
    False - tested this in ex16.c and two constants can have the same value.
    
(e) Enumeration constants may be used as integers in expressions.
    True - tested also in ex16.c
